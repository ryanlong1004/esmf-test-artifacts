This applies only to I/O errors for system read() and write() calls made as a result of MPI I/O calls. It does not apply to I/O errors for other MPI I/O calls such as MPI_File_open(), nor does it apply to read() and write() calls made by means other than MPI I/O calls. Abort on error is not standard behavior. The MPI Standard specifies that the default error handling for MPI I/O calls is to return an error code to the application rather than aborting the application, but since errors on write or read are almost always unexpected and usually not recoverable, it may be preferable to abort as soon as the error is detected. Doing so does not allow any recovery, but does provide the most information about the error and terminates the job quickly. If the Cray Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) feature is enabled, the abort will result in a full stack backtrace writte

See the notes below on the order of nodes. Network traffic and resulting I/O performance may be affected by the assignments. If set to 1, consecutive nodes are used. The number of aggregators assigned per node is controlled by the cb_config_list hint. By default, no more than one aggregator per node will be assigned if there are at least as many nodes as aggregators. If set to a value greater than 1, node selection is strided across the available nodes by this value. If the stride times the number of aggregators exceeds the number of nodes, the assignments will wrap around, which is usually not optimal for performance. If set to -1, node selection is strided across available nodes by the value of the number of nodes divided by the number of aggregators (integer division, minimum value of 1). The purpose is to spread out the nodes to reduce network congestion. Note:  The order of nodes can be shown by setting the MPICH_RANK

As described in the dvs(5) man page, the environment variable DVS_MAXNODES can be used to set the stripe width— that is, the number of DVS server nodes—used to access a file in "stripe parallel mode." For most files, and especially for small files, setting DVS_MAXNODES to 1 ("cluster parallel mode") is preferred. The MPICH_MPIIO_DVS_MAXNODES environment variable enables you to leave DVS_MAXNODES set to 1 and then use MPICH_MPIIO_DVS_MAXNODES to temporarily override DVS_MAXNODES when it is advantageous to specify wider striping for files being opened by the MPI_File_open() call. The range of values accepted by MPICH_MPIIO_DVS_MAXNODES goes from 1 to the number of server nodes specified on the mount with the nnodes mount option. DVS_MAXNODES is not set by default. Therefore, for MPICH_MPIIO_DVS_MAXNODES to have any effect, DVS_MAXNODES must be defined before p

This also overrides any values that were set by using calls to MPI_Info_set in the application code. The new values apply to the file the next time it is opened using an MPI_File_open() call. After the MPI_File_open() call, subsequent MPI_Info_set calls can be used to pass new MPI I/O hints that take precedence over some of the environment variable values. Other MPI I/O hints such as striping_factor, striping_unit, cb_nodes, and cb_config_list cannot be changed after the MPI_File_open() call, as these are evaluated and applied only during the file open process. An MPI_File_close call followed by an MPI_File_open call can be used to restart the MPI I/O hint evaluation process. The syntax for this environment variable is a comma- separated list of specifications. Each individual specification is a pathname_pattern followed by a colon- separated list of one or more key=value pairs. In each key=value pair, the key is the MPI-IO hint name, and the v

In addition, the MPICH_MAX_THREAD_SAFETY environment variable must be set to multiple in order to enable this feature. Note:  This feature offers improved communication/computation overlap behavior for MPI-3 non- blocking collectives on systems running CLE release 5.2 UP02 or later. While this feature is backwards-compatible with earlier versions of CLE, sites interested in using this feature to obtain best performance are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of CLE. For both Gemini and Aries systems, if MPICH_NEMESIS_ASYNC_PROGRESS is set to SC, the network interface DMA engine will enable the asynchronous progress feature. For Aries systems running CLE 5.0 or later only, if MPICH_NEMESIS_ASYNC_PROGRESS is set to MC, the Aries network interface DMA engine will employ a method that makes more efficient use of all the available virtual channels for asynchronous progress. Note:  Enabling these modes may slow down applications that lack sufficient

This feature works on top of the MPICH_NEMESIS_ASYNC_PROGRESS feature to offer improved communication/computation overlap. This feature is particularly helpful in offering overlap  when the communication pattern involves large on-node transfers interleaved with off-node transfers. The on-node async-progres optimization is  meaningful only if MPICH_NEMESIS_ASYNC_PROGRESS is enabled.  Depending on the communication pattern, enabling the on-node async-progress optimization can negatively impact the the communication latency. In such cases, if the benefits of on-node async-progress are out-weighed by the higher communication latency, it is advisable to disable the on-node async-progress feature using the MPICH_NEMESIS_ON_NODE_ASYNC_OPT variable. On Cray XC systems, this feature is enabled by default. On Cray XE and XK systems, this feature is intentionally disabled by default. Users can set the MPICH_NEMESIS_ON_NODE_ASYNC_OPT to override the d

This applies only to I/O errors for system read() and write() calls made as a result of MPI I/O calls. It does not apply to I/O errors for other MPI I/O calls such as MPI_File_open(), nor does it apply to read() and write() calls made by means other than MPI I/O calls. Abort on error is not standard behavior. The MPI Standard specifies that the default error handling for MPI I/O calls is to return an error code to the application rather than aborting the application, but since errors on write or read are almost always unexpected and usually not recoverable, it may be preferable to abort as soon as the error is detected. Doing so does not allow any recovery, but does provide the most information about the error and terminates the job quickly. If the Cray Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) feature is enabled, the abort will result in a full stack backtrace writte

See the notes below on the order of nodes. Network traffic and resulting I/O performance may be affected by the assignments. If set to 1, consecutive nodes are used. The number of aggregators assigned per node is controlled by the cb_config_list hint. By default, no more than one aggregator per node will be assigned if there are at least as many nodes as aggregators. If set to a value greater than 1, node selection is strided across the available nodes by this value. If the stride times the number of aggregators exceeds the number of nodes, the assignments will wrap around, which is usually not optimal for performance. If set to -1, node selection is strided across available nodes by the value of the number of nodes divided by the number of aggregators (integer division, minimum value of 1). The purpose is to spread out the nodes to reduce network congestion. Note:  The order of nodes can be shown by setting the MPICH_RANK

As described in the dvs(5) man page, the environment variable DVS_MAXNODES can be used to set the stripe width— that is, the number of DVS server nodes—used to access a file in "stripe parallel mode." For most files, and especially for small files, setting DVS_MAXNODES to 1 ("cluster parallel mode") is preferred. The MPICH_MPIIO_DVS_MAXNODES environment variable enables you to leave DVS_MAXNODES set to 1 and then use MPICH_MPIIO_DVS_MAXNODES to temporarily override DVS_MAXNODES when it is advantageous to specify wider striping for files being opened by the MPI_File_open() call. The range of values accepted by MPICH_MPIIO_DVS_MAXNODES goes from 1 to the number of server nodes specified on the mount with the nnodes mount option. DVS_MAXNODES is not set by default. Therefore, for MPICH_MPIIO_DVS_MAXNODES to have any effect, DVS_MAXNODES must be defined before p

This also overrides any values that were set by using calls to MPI_Info_set in the application code. The new values apply to the file the next time it is opened using an MPI_File_open() call. After the MPI_File_open() call, subsequent MPI_Info_set calls can be used to pass new MPI I/O hints that take precedence over some of the environment variable values. Other MPI I/O hints such as striping_factor, striping_unit, cb_nodes, and cb_config_list cannot be changed after the MPI_File_open() call, as these are evaluated and applied only during the file open process. An MPI_File_close call followed by an MPI_File_open call can be used to restart the MPI I/O hint evaluation process.

Each individual specification is a pathname_pattern followed by a colon- separated list of one or more key=value pairs. In each key=value pair, the key is the MPI-IO hint name, and the v

This feature works on top of the MPICH_NEMESIS_ASYNC_PROGRESS feature to offer improved communication/computation overlap. This feature is particularly helpful in offering overlap  when the communication pattern involves large on-node transfers interleaved with off-node transfers. The on-node async-progres optimization is  meaningful only if MPICH_NEMESIS_ASYNC_PROGRESS is enabled.  Depending on the communication pattern, enabling the on-node async-progress optimization can negatively impact the the communication latency. In such cases, if the benefits of on-node async-progress are out-weighed by the higher communication latency, it is advisable to disable the on-node async-progress feature using the MPICH_NEMESIS_ON_NODE_ASYNC_OPT variable. On Cray XC systems, this feature is enabled by default. On Cray XE and XK systems, this feature is intentionally disabled by default.

This applies only to I/O errors for system read() and write() calls made as a result of MPI I/O calls. It does not apply to I/O errors for other MPI I/O calls such as MPI_File_open(), nor does it apply to read() and write() calls made by means other than MPI I/O calls. Abort on error is not standard behavior. The MPI Standard specifies that the default error handling for MPI I/O calls is to return an error code to the application rather than aborting the application, but since errors on write or read are almost always unexpected and usually not recoverable, it may be preferable to abort as soon as the error is detected. Doing so does not allow any recovery, but does provide the most information about the error and terminates the job quickly. If the Cray Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) feature is enabled, the abort will result in a full stack backtrace writte

See the notes below on the order of nodes. Network traffic and resulting I/O performance may be affected by the assignments. If set to 1, consecutive nodes are used. The number of aggregators assigned per node is controlled by the cb_config_list hint. By default, no more than one aggregator per node will be assigned if there are at least as many nodes as aggregators. If set to a value greater than 1, node selection is strided across the available nodes by this value. If the stride times the number of aggregators exceeds the number of nodes, the assignments will wrap around, which is usually not optimal for performance. If set to -1, node selection is strided across available nodes by the value of the number of nodes divided by the number of aggregators (integer division, minimum value of 1). The purpose is to spread out the nodes to reduce network congestion. Note:  The order of nodes can be shown by setting the MPICH_RANK

As described in the dvs(5) man page, the environment variable DVS_MAXNODES can be used to set the stripe width— that is, the number of DVS server nodes—used to access a file in "stripe parallel mode." For most files, and especially for small files, setting DVS_MAXNODES to 1 ("cluster parallel mode") is preferred. The MPICH_MPIIO_DVS_MAXNODES environment variable enables you to leave DVS_MAXNODES set to 1 and then use MPICH_MPIIO_DVS_MAXNODES to temporarily override DVS_MAXNODES when it is advantageous to specify wider striping for files being opened by the MPI_File_open() call. The range of values accepted by MPICH_MPIIO_DVS_MAXNODES goes from 1 to the number of server nodes specified on the mount with the nnodes mount option. DVS_MAXNODES is not set by default. Therefore, for MPICH_MPIIO_DVS_MAXNODES to have any effect, DVS_MAXNODES must be defined before p

Other MPI I/O hints such as striping_factor, striping_unit, cb_nodes, and cb_config_list cannot be changed after the MPI_File_open() call, as these are evaluated and applied only during the file open process.

It does not apply to I/O errors for other MPI I/O calls such as MPI_File_open(), nor does it apply to read() and write() calls made by means other than MPI I/O calls. Abort on error is not standard behavior. The MPI Standard specifies that the default error handling for MPI I/O calls is to return an error code to the application rather than aborting the application, but since errors on write or read are almost always unexpected and usually not recoverable, it may be preferable to abort as soon as the error is detected. Doing so does not allow any recovery, but does provide the most information about the error and terminates the job quickly. If the Cray Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) feature is enabled, the abort will result in a full stack backtrace writte

The number of aggregators assigned per node is controlled by the cb_config_list hint. By default, no more than one aggregator per node will be assigned if there are at least as many nodes as aggregators. If set to a value greater than 1, node selection is strided across the available nodes by this value. If the stride times the number of aggregators exceeds the number of nodes, the assignments will wrap around, which is usually not optimal for performance. If set to -1, node selection is strided across available nodes by the value of the number of nodes divided by the number of aggregators (integer division, minimum value of 1). The purpose is to spread out the nodes to reduce network congestion. Note:  The order of nodes can be shown by setting the MPICH_RANK

For most files, and especially for small files, setting DVS_MAXNODES to 1 ("cluster parallel mode") is preferred. The MPICH_MPIIO_DVS_MAXNODES environment variable enables you to leave DVS_MAXNODES set to 1 and then use MPICH_MPIIO_DVS_MAXNODES to temporarily override DVS_MAXNODES when it is advantageous to specify wider striping for files being opened by the MPI_File_open() call. The range of values accepted by MPICH_MPIIO_DVS_MAXNODES goes from 1 to the number of server nodes specified on the mount with the nnodes mount option. DVS_MAXNODES is not set by default.

In addition, the MPICH_MAX_THREAD_SAFETY environment variable must be set to multiple in order to enable this feature. Note:  This feature offers improved communication/computation overlap behavior for MPI-3 non- blocking collectives on systems running CLE release 5.2 UP02 or later. While this feature is backwards-compatible with earlier versions of CLE, sites interested in using this feature to obtain best performance are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of CLE. For both Gemini and Aries systems, if MPICH_NEMESIS_ASYNC_PROGRESS is set to SC, the network interface DMA engine will enable the asynchronous progress feature. For Aries systems running CLE 5.0 or later only, if MPICH_NEMESIS_ASYNC_PROGRESS is set to MC, the Aries network interface DMA engine will employ a method that makes more efficient use of all the available virtual channels for asynchronous progress.

This feature works on top of the MPICH_NEMESIS_ASYNC_PROGRESS feature to offer improved communication/computation overlap. This feature is particularly helpful in offering overlap  when the communication pattern involves large on-node transfers interleaved with off-node transfers. The on-node async-progres optimization is  meaningful only if MPICH_NEMESIS_ASYNC_PROGRESS is enabled.  Depending on the communication pattern, enabling the on-node async-progress optimization can negatively impact the the communication latency. In such cases, if the benefits of on-node async-progress are out-weighed by the higher communication latency, it is advisable to disable the on-node async-progress feature using the MPICH_NEMESIS_ON_NODE_ASYNC_OPT variable. On Cray XC systems, this feature is enabled by default. On Cray XE and XK systems, this feature is intentionally disabled by default. Users can set the MPICH_NEMESIS_ON_NODE_ASYNC_OPT to override the d

This applies only to I/O errors for system read() and write() calls made as a result of MPI I/O calls. It does not apply to I/O errors for other MPI I/O calls such as MPI_File_open(), nor does it apply to read() and write() calls made by means other than MPI I/O calls. Abort on error is not standard behavior. The MPI Standard specifies that the default error handling for MPI I/O calls is to return an error code to the application rather than aborting the application, but since errors on write or read are almost always unexpected and usually not recoverable, it may be preferable to abort as soon as the error is detected. Doing so does not allow any recovery, but does provide the most information about the error and terminates the job quickly. If the Cray Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) feature is enabled, the abort will result in a full stack backtrace writte

See the notes below on the order of nodes. Network traffic and resulting I/O performance may be affected by the assignments. If set to 1, consecutive nodes are used. The number of aggregators assigned per node is controlled by the cb_config_list hint. By default, no more than one aggregator per node will be assigned if there are at least as many nodes as aggregators. If set to a value greater than 1, node selection is strided across the available nodes by this value. If the stride times the number of aggregators exceeds the number of nodes, the assignments will wrap around, which is usually not optimal for performance. If set to -1, node selection is strided across available nodes by the value of the number of nodes divided by the number of aggregators (integer division, minimum value of 1). The purpose is to spread out the nodes to reduce network congestion. Note:  The order of nodes can be shown by setting the MPICH_RANK

As described in the dvs(5) man page, the environment variable DVS_MAXNODES can be used to set the stripe width— that is, the number of DVS server nodes—used to access a file in "stripe parallel mode." For most files, and especially for small files, setting DVS_MAXNODES to 1 ("cluster parallel mode") is preferred. The MPICH_MPIIO_DVS_MAXNODES environment variable enables you to leave DVS_MAXNODES set to 1 and then use MPICH_MPIIO_DVS_MAXNODES to temporarily override DVS_MAXNODES when it is advantageous to specify wider striping for files being opened by the MPI_File_open() call. The range of values accepted by MPICH_MPIIO_DVS_MAXNODES goes from 1 to the number of server nodes specified on the mount with the nnodes mount option. DVS_MAXNODES is not set by default. Therefore, for MPICH_MPIIO_DVS_MAXNODES to have any effect, DVS_MAXNODES must be defined before p

This also overrides any values that were set by using calls to MPI_Info_set in the application code. The new values apply to the file the next time it is opened using an MPI_File_open() call. After the MPI_File_open() call, subsequent MPI_Info_set calls can be used to pass new MPI I/O hints that take precedence over some of the environment variable values. Other MPI I/O hints such as striping_factor, striping_unit, cb_nodes, and cb_config_list cannot be changed after the MPI_File_open() call, as these are evaluated and applied only during the file open process. An MPI_File_close call followed by an MPI_File_open call can be used to restart the MPI I/O hint evaluation process.

Each individual specification is a pathname_pattern followed by a colon- separated list of one or more key=value pairs. In each key=value pair, the key is the MPI-IO hint name, and the v

This feature works on top of the MPICH_NEMESIS_ASYNC_PROGRESS feature to offer improved communication/computation overlap. This feature is particularly helpful in offering overlap  when the communication pattern involves large on-node transfers interleaved with off-node transfers. The on-node async-progres optimization is  meaningful only if MPICH_NEMESIS_ASYNC_PROGRESS is enabled.  Depending on the communication pattern, enabling the on-node async-progress optimization can negatively impact the the communication latency. In such cases, if the benefits of on-node async-progress are out-weighed by the higher communication latency, it is advisable to disable the on-node async-progress feature using the MPICH_NEMESIS_ON_NODE_ASYNC_OPT variable. On Cray XC systems, this feature is enabled by default. On Cray XE and XK systems, this feature is intentionally disabled by default.

This variable currently affects the memory affinity  of the mail-boxes used for off-node communication, and the shared-memory regions that are used for on-node pt2pt and collective ops.  On systems that do not offer High Bandwidth Memory capabilities, (such as Intel Haswell or Broadwell processors), this env. variable is ignored and memory affinity is set to DDR. On Phi processors, such as KNL (and KNH, KNP in the future), this env. variable allows users to specifically request the internal memory regions used by the MPI library to be bound to either DDR, or the MCDRAM. The default affinity settings will be governed by the system defaults. For example, on a KNL system configured in the Quad/Flat mode, if the job is run with numactl --membind=1, all of MPI's internal memory will be bound to MCDRAM if this variable is not set.

This applies only to I/O errors for system read() and write() calls made as a result of MPI I/O calls. It does not apply to I/O errors for other MPI I/O calls such as MPI_File_open(), nor does it apply to read() and write() calls made by means other than MPI I/O calls. Abort on error is not standard behavior. The MPI Standard specifies that the default error handling for MPI I/O calls is to return an error code to the application rather than aborting the application, but since errors on write or read are almost always unexpected and usually not recoverable, it may be preferable to abort as soon as the error is detected. Doing so does not allow any recovery, but does provide the most information about the error and terminates the job quickly. If the Cray Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) feature is enabled, the abort will result in a full stack backtrace writte

See the notes below on the order of nodes. Network traffic and resulting I/O performance may be affected by the assignments. If set to 1, consecutive nodes are used. The number of aggregators assigned per node is controlled by the cb_config_list hint. By default, no more than one aggregator per node will be assigned if there are at least as many nodes as aggregators. If set to a value greater than 1, node selection is strided across the available nodes by this value. If the stride times the number of aggregators exceeds the number of nodes, the assignments will wrap around, which is usually not optimal for performance. If set to -1, node selection is strided across available nodes by the value of the number of nodes divided by the number of aggregators (integer division, minimum value of 1). The purpose is to spread out the nodes to reduce network congestion. Note:  The order of nodes can be shown by setting the MPICH_RANK

As described in the dvs(5) man page, the environment variable DVS_MAXNODES can be used to set the stripe width— that is, the number of DVS server nodes—used to access a file in "stripe parallel mode." For most files, and especially for small files, setting DVS_MAXNODES to 1 ("cluster parallel mode") is preferred. The MPICH_MPIIO_DVS_MAXNODES environment variable enables you to leave DVS_MAXNODES set to 1 and then use MPICH_MPIIO_DVS_MAXNODES to temporarily override DVS_MAXNODES when it is advantageous to specify wider striping for files being opened by the MPI_File_open() call.
